    <h3>CAST & CREATIVE</h3>

    <div id="p1">
        <p>Our creators told over 16,000 stories over the course of 5 days in a 100-minute musical using 12 actors. Many
            of the characters in our show are based on real people or composites of them. The cast took a trip to
            Newfoundland, where they met the people who inspired our story, visited the places we recreate on stage
            every day, and experienced firsthand the Newfoundland hospitality.
